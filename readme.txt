= What are the benefits? =
Martin's free and easy ad network will automatically provide ad impressions for your website across a network of websites.


= 3rd party service notice =
This plugin relies on the free 3rd party "Martin's Tools, Ad Network" (Software as a Service) and sends some of your URLs to the service to create an ad statistics dashboard for you.

= Are matched ads possible for small niches and foreign languages? =

You should test it with your own website. Depending on your niche and language, you might encounter less relevant ads. Your website might be unique, resulting in fewer matches.

The network expands daily, and match quality improves with its growth.

Feel free to try again later if these free ads don't match your website properly at the moment. 
However, please refrain from leaving a negative review solely because your specific website isn't matched properly for now.


= Are statistics available? =
In your WordPress admin menu, you will discover a beautifully designed dashboard labeled "Martin's Ad Network". 
This dashboard provides one month of detailed statistics.

= How does it work? =
A small, neat ad bar featuring text ads will appear on all websites.

Every time a website displays an ad to a unique visitor, credits are earned. These credits are then automatically utilized for a campaign tailored to that specific website.

Ad campaigns are automatically created, and websites are scanned to identify their most effective keywords for use across the network. You have the flexibility to customize your ad at any time or utilize the default settings, which automatically generate your ad from your website content.

This plugin is just one component of a larger ad network puzzle, supported by a sophisticated and intelligent web crawler similar to Google's.

Works perfectly as a free alternative to Google Ads, Facebook Ads and Bing Ads. 


= How about offensive content? =
Websites like "po.." etc., are allowed, but they are automatically added to their own separate network.
